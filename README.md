fish-artisan-completion
=======================

[Artisan][artisan] command completion for the [fish][fish] shell

Installation
------------

You can manually install this by copying the files in the
[completions](completions) directory to `~/.config/fish/completions/` on your
machine.

Or, if you have one, you can use a plugin manager.

Usage
-----
The completion works on both `php artisan` and `./artisan`. A function or alias
named `artisan` will work too.
